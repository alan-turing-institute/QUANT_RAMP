"""
costMSOAToPoint
Take the MSOA to MSOA cost matrix and build a variant for MSOA to a point dataset based on 
MSOA to MSOA plus an additional straight line distance from the point to the nearest
MSOA centroid

The Plan:
    foreach point in points
    find closest msoa
    find distance offset to closest msoa and delta time (crowfly time to this nearest msoa to point)
    foreach MSOA
    lookup MSOA to closest MSOA (from cij) plus delta time
    write MSOA->point matrix with cij + delta time to point

NOTE: also see databuilder.computeGeolytixCosts() for the same basic methodology
PRE: uses the QUANTCijRoadCentroidsFilename file from model-runs for the cij centroid points - not same as zonecodes
@param cij cost matrix for MSOA to MSOA, zones identified by zonecodes (numpy array)
@param dfPoints the DataFrame containing [zonei,east,north] for our points
@returns an matrix that is count(points) x count(zonecodes) (i.e. cols x rows so [pointi,zonecodei])
